# C++ Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of classical algorithms using **C++**.  
Each program demonstrates a solution for optimization and problem-solving tasks.

## 📌 Included Algorithms
1. **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)**  
   - Finds the shortest path visiting all cities and returning to the start.  
   - Implemented using brute force (permutations).  

2. **Assignment Problem**  
   - Assigns workers to tasks with minimum total cost.  
   - Implemented using backtracking and cost minimization.  

## 🛠️ Technologies
- C++
- Visual Studio Code / Code::Blocks

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpp-algorithms.git
